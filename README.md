# Oval Diamond Quality Script
I had a hard time finding a tool that allowed me to quickly eliminate choices of oval shaped diamonds to buy, so I made this script using recommendations from folks at The Diamond Pro (see reference below). 

## Requirements
You'll have to have the Table %, Depth %, diamond length, and diamond width values on hand (usually found in a GIA report). Other than that you will need to have python3 running and working on your computer.

## Running the program
After going to the directory where the script lives, run
```python3 diamond_oval.py```
and the script will ask you for the values. Enter them in and the script will end with its recommendation of the quality level (either Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair, or Poor).

## Reference
I found the numbers to go by for oval diamonds at [The Diamond Pro](https://www.diamonds.pro/education/oval-cut/). Feel free to checkout the website for some really good pointers!
