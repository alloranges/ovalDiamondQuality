# Oval Diamond Quality Script
This script helps decide if an oval shaped diamond has good properties.

## Requirements
You'll have to have the Table %, Depth %, diamond length, and diamond width values on hand (usually found in a GIA report). Other than that you will need to have Python or Go running and working on your computer.

## Running the program
After going to the directory where the script lives, enter one of the following in terminal:

### Python
```bash
python3 diamond_oval.py
```
### Go
```bash
go run diamond_oval.go
```

Then enter values following the prompts. The script will end with its quality level for each criteria (will be either Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair, or Poor).

## Additional Information
[The Diamond Pro](https://www.diamonds.pro/education/oval-cut/) for the criteria reference. Feel free to checkout the website for some really good pointers!

Oval diamonds may have a cross-sectional center with dead light (a bow-tie), which can only be determined visually. Be sure to view the diamond from different angles!
